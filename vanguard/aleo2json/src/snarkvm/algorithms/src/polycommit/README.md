# snarkvm-algorithms/polycommit

This module implements (univariate) *polynomial commitment schemes*. This library was initially developed as part of the [Marlin paper][marlin].

## Overview

A (univariate) polynomial commitment scheme is a cryptographic primitive that enables a party to commit to a univariate polynomial and then, later on, to reveal desired evaluations of the polynomial along with cryptographic proofs attesting to their correctness.

This library provides various constructions of polynomial commitment schemes. These constructions support committing to multiple polynomials at a time with differing degree bounds, batching multiple evaluation proofs for the same evaluation point into a single one, and batch verification of proofs.

The key properties satisfied by the polynomial commitment schemes are **succinctness**, **extractability**, and **hiding**. See [the Marlin paper][marlin] for definitions of these properties.

## Profiling

This library is instrumented with profiling infrastructure that prints detailed traces of execution time. To enable this, compile with `cargo build --features profiler`.
