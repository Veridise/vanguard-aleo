# Vanguard for Aleo

This repo hosts an open-source Python branch of the static analysis tool Vanguard developed by Veridise. This version is optimized for analyzing Leo/Aleo programs.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries are required for running (different components of) the tool:

- Rust (1.73+) for running `aleo2json`
- Python (3.10+) for running Vanguard and its Aleo detectors
  - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html) (2.8.4+) for speeding up graph reachability in detectors

## The Aleo to JSON Compiler

Running of Vanguard for Aleo relies on a compiler that converts Aleo programs into JSON, which allows the program to be further analyzed by various tools and extensions. It's adapted from Aleo's [snarkVM](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkVM/). To allow Vanguard to directly process Aleo programs, we recommend installing the compiler while testing out the tool via:

```bash
cd vanguard/aleo2json/
cargo install --path .
```

To remove it in the future, simply do:

```bash
cargo uninstall aleo2json
```

### Usage

The `aleo2json` tool takes as input a path to `*.aleo` file, and directly outputs the compiled JSON, which includes enhanced information of the program and basic analysis results (e.g., variable types, visibilities, etc.):

```bash
aleo2json <path-to-aleo-file>
```

## Vanguard for Aleo

The library of Vanguard for Aleo provides both integration with the `aleo2json` tool, as well as basic utilities for writing detectors based on static analysis. We've also included detectors for several common vulnerabilities.

### Library Usage

The analyzer can be installed via `pip` setup tools by running:

```bash
pip install .
```

and if you want to remove it:

```bash
pip uninstall vanguard
```

You can write detectors by simply utilizing some functions provided by the analyzer. Here's an example that analyze and get all public outputs/signals from a given Aleo program:

```python
from vanguard.aleo.common import aleo2json, get_public_outputs

aleo_path = ...
aleo_json = aleo2json(aleo_path)

pub_outs = get_public_outputs(aleo_json["functions"]["main"])
if len(pub_outs)>0:
  print(f"There are public outputs: {pub_outs}.")
```

### APIs (Coming Soon)

APIs are located in `vanguard/aleo/common.py` and `vanguard/aleo/detectors/*`, we are working on adding more of them as well as a documentation. Stay tuned!
